#NutriBalance
##Backgrounder
Responding to the alarming rates of obesity in Indonesia, our project addresses the issue by promoting nutrition awareness. The 2022 UNICEF report revealed that 14.8% of adolescents and 35.5% of adults in Indonesia struggle with obesity due to unhealthy eating habits.
To tackle this, we developed NutriBalance, a mobile app providing essential nutritional information for various foods, fostering awareness and understanding of dietary choices. The app integrates machine learning for accurate nutritional data on scanned food images and includes a secure login system via Firebase for real-time connectivity.
Machine Learning: involves data collection, data processing, and data exploration to achieve data accuracy on image objects
Mobile Development: Implementing TensorFlow Lite to scan images and create a user application. The application integrates a login system with Google accounts using Firebase and real-time connectivity to run the application.
Cloud Computing: Creating a backend and API endpoints for food nutrition data that enable post, get, put, and delete operations on the admin side. The system also accepts requests from the user side and provides corresponding responses. Implementing image storage in cloud storage that can be publicly accessed when displaying information about food nutrition data.
NutriBalance aims to reduce the number of overweight individuals from 67.7 million to 60 million within five years. By fostering a culture of informed nutritional choices, the app contributes to a healthier Indonesian society. NutriBalance reflects our commitment to leveraging technology for public health improvement.
